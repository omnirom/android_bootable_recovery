/* Bootloader Message (2-KiB)
 *
 * This structure describes the content of a block in flash
 * that is used for recovery and the bootloader to talk to
 * each other.
 *
 * The command field is updated by linux when it wants to
 * reboot into recovery or to update radio or bootloader firmware.
 * It is also updated by the bootloader when firmware update
 * is complete (to boot into recovery for any final cleanup)
 *
 * The status field was used by the bootloader after the completion
 * of an "update-radio" or "update-hboot" command, which has been
 * deprecated since Froyo.
 *
 * The recovery field is only written by linux and used
 * for the system to send a message to recovery or the
 * other way around.
 *
 * The stage field is written by packages which restart themselves
 * multiple times, so that the UI can reflect which invocation of the
 * package it is.  If the value is of the format "#/#" (eg, "1/3"),
 * the UI will add a simple indicator of that status.
 *
 * We used to have slot_suffix field for A/B boot control metadata in
 * this struct, which gets unintentionally cleared by recovery or
 * uncrypt. Move it into struct bootloader_message_ab to avoid the
 * issue.
