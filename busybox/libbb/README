libbb is BusyBox's utility library.  All of this stuff used to be stuffed into
a single file named utility.c.  When I split utility.c to create libbb, some of
the very oldest stuff ended up without their original copyright and licensing
information (which is now lost in the mists of time).  If you see something
that you wrote that is mis-attributed, do let me know so we can fix that up.
