<h2>Specification</h2>

For requests which have information attached after the header, such as
HTTP POST or PUT, the information will be sent to the script on stdin.
<p>

The server will send <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html#cl">CONTENT_LENGTH</a> bytes on
this file descriptor. Remember that it will give the <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/env.html#ct">CONTENT_TYPE</a> of the data as well. The server is
in no way obligated to send end-of-file after the script reads
<code>CONTENT_LENGTH</code> bytes. </p><p>
</p><hr>
<h2>Example</h2>

Let's take a form with METHOD="POST" as an example. Let's say the form
results are 7 bytes encoded, and look like <code>a=b&amp;b=c</code>.
<p>

In this case, the server will set CONTENT_LENGTH to 7 and CONTENT_TYPE
to application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The first byte on the script's
standard input will be "a", followed by the rest of the encoded string.</p><p>
