# bug was that we treated <newline> as ';' in this line:
true || echo foo |
echo BAD1 | cat

# variation on the same theme
true || echo foo |
# comment
echo BAD2 | cat

# variation on the same theme
true || echo foo |

echo BAD3 | cat

# this should error out, but currently works in hush:
#true || echo foo |;

echo Done:$?
