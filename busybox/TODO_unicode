Already fixed applets:
cal
lsmod
df
dumpleases

Applets which may need unicode handling (more extensive than sanitizing
of filenames in error messages):

ls - work in progress
expand, unexpand - uses unicode_strlen, not scrlen
ash, hush through lineedit - uses unicode_strlen, not scrlen
top - need to sanitize process args
ps - need to sanitize process args
less
more
vi
ed
cut
awk
sed
tr
grep egrep fgrep
fold
sort
head, tail
catv - "display nonprinting chars" - what this could mean for unicode?
wc
chat
dumpkmap
last - just line up columns
man
microcom
strings
watch

Unsure, may need fixing:

hostname - do we really want to protect against bad chars in it?
patch
addgroup, adduser, delgroup, deluser
telnet
telnetd
od
printf
