Quickstart on making the Busybox boot-floppy:

  1) Download Busybox and uClibc from CVS or tarballs. Make sure they share a
     common parent directory. (i.e. busybox/ and uclibc/ are both right off of
	 /tmp, or wherever.)

  2) Build a Linux kernel. Make sure you include support for initrd.

  3) Put a floppy in the drive. Make sure it is a floppy you don't care about
     because the contents will be overwritten.

  4) As root, type ./mksyslinux.sh path/to/linux/kernel from this directory.
     Wait patiently while the magic happens.

  5) Boot up on the floppy.
