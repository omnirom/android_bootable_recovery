      "message": "The /sys/class/leds/lm3533-lcd-bl-1/brightness path is probably specific to only one device. This whole block of code then is useless for all other devices. We should probably have a build flag for a second brightness file that can be passed in from the device files. It would be an extremely rare case that I will merge code that only works on one device.",

Further, the sysctl list appears to contain many device specific items like lm3533-lcd-bl. In mainline TWRP we try to keep device specifics out of the code base.",

You are making sense though.\n\nThe reason why this is working this particular way was to ensure it will skip scanning lcd-backlight until it really can not find anything elsewhere.\n\nIf you have any idea how to achieve that with Find_File, I will happily incorporate that.",
