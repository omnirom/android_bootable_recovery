      "message": "If we force the backup file system to ext4 and the partition is currently using vfat, this would result in restoring as ext4. I\u0027m not sure if this is a huge concern as it is unlikely that we\u0027ll change the file system of a partition like \"modem\". However, I think with the way the change is right now, Backup_File_System isn\u0027t being updated after initial boot, which may have some unintended consequences even for partitions that do not have a forced backup file system.",
