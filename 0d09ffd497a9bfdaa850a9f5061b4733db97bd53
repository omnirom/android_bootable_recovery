      "message": "These 3 conditions will cover most relevant cases, but I admit there is a regression from the existing behavior. If a user specifies a Display_Name which happens to be the same as the auto generated one (and that person really wants this name applied), then has_display_name is assigned false here and Display_Name will pick up whatever the user specified for Storage_Name. I really don\u0027t want to create global temporary variables, but have not yet figured out how to handle this issue more elegantly.",
