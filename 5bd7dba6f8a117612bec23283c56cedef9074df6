      "message": "I think you could simplify this code. Mount_By_Path was written to handle mounting full paths. For example, if you do a Mount_By_Path(\"/cache/recovery/openrecoveryscript\"), the function will know to mount /cache. Likewise it would mount /data/cache/recovery/openrecoveryscript and no matter where the \"cache\" partition is located, it would need to be mounted. I think it would be better to just Mount_By_Path(orsFile) and not check if the cache dir is a NON_AB_CACHE_DIR.",
