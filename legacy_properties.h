/*
** Rules:
**
** - there is only one writer, but many readers
** - prop_area.count will never decrease in value
** - once allocated, a prop_info's name will not change
** - once allocated, a prop_info's offset will not change
** - reading a value requires the following steps
**   1. serial = pi->serial
**   2. if SERIAL_DIRTY(serial), wait*, then goto 1
**   3. memcpy(local, pi->value, SERIAL_VALUE_LEN(serial) + 1)
**   4. if pi->serial != serial, goto 2
**
** - writing a value requires the following steps
**   1. pi->serial = pi->serial | 1
**   2. memcpy(pi->value, local_value, value_len)
**   3. pi->serial = (value_len << 24) | ((pi->serial + 1) & 0xffffff)
**
** Improvements:
** - maintain the toc sorted by pi->name to allow lookup
**   by binary search
