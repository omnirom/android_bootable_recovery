      "message": "After making this change, my device decrypts perfectly fine without needing to press \"Cancel\" after an incorrect password is input. This works for both TWRP crypto and vold decrypt - the vold services seem to stop properly after the incorrect password fails, and they appear to start properly once a new password is input, even allowing the TWRP crypto to either succeed, fail or timeout before proceeding to vold decrypt. This solves Scenario #3 on my U11. I\u0027m uploading a test build for my U12+ tester to see if it also fixes Scenario #4, though even if it doesn\u0027t, I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s the fault of this patch.",
