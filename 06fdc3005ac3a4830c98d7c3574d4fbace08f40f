      "message": "If we\u0027re going to reboot no matter what, would it make more sense to just call TWFunc::tw_reboot here. Then, we wouldn\u0027t need to make all of the theme changes to hide the home and back buttons.\n\nIf we still want to change the theme, then perhaps the variable used should be a little more generic: tw_sideload_reboot -\u003e tw_action_complete_hide_nav_buttons\n\nor something... in case we want hide the nav buttons on the action page for a different reason.",

      "message": "This was actually the way I first approached the problem, restart here. It\u0027ll scare users who see red text flash about failure to copy logs and one other minor inconvenience that I can\u0027t recall off the top of my head. Ultimately, I much prefer this approach as TWRP will cleanly finish its operations before reboot occurs. I hope you\u0027ll agree.\n\nI really didn\u0027t need to create a variable sideload_auto_reboot here and push this conditional to the bottom of the sideload routine. I\u0027ll move it up.\n\nI agree, a more generic \"hide the buttons\" variable is appropriate. I can create a new patch set.",
