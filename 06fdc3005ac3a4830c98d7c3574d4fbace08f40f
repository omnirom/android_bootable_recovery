Then, we wouldn\u0027t need to make all of the theme changes to hide the home and back buttons.\n\nIf we still want to change the theme, then perhaps the variable used should be a little more generic: tw_sideload_reboot -\u003e tw_action_complete_hide_nav_buttons\n\nor something... in case we want hide the nav buttons on the action page for a different reason.",
