 * is complete (to boot into recovery for any final cleanup)
 *
 * The status field is written by the bootloader after the
 * completion of an "update-radio" or "update-hboot" command.
 *
 * The recovery field is only written by linux and used
 * for the system to send a message to recovery or the
 * other way around.
