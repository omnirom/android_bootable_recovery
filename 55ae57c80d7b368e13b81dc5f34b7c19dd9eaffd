      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that setting this path automatically is a safe idea and I think we should leave it up to the device configs to set it properly. I suppose if we\u0027re certain that no devices use any other path then it might be ok, but I know we have some TWRP devices set up to use the TeamWin device/qcom/common path instead of this one. I suspect that decrypt will work with either.",

Lineage cryptfs_hw is just more up to date with CAF. It\u0027s been tested on all my devices (find7, r7, r7plus, ether, lettuce) and hw decrypt works fine.",

      "message": "I sadly must disagree. A look at the github bug tracker and XDA show that many users have decryption issues when using TWRP in conjunction with a current LineageOS. Here are two examples for Xioamoi Devices which personally know they don\u0027t work because of this. However there are many more devices of many more manufacturers affected.\n\nhttps://github.com/TeamWin/Team-Win-Recovery-Project/issues/1108\n\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p\u003d74822607\u0026postcount\u003d412",
